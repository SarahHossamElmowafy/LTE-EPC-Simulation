# LTE-EPC-Simulation
Abstract
In this project, we simulate the LTE with EPC network using NS-3. The simulation 
is done through three different types of applications and the information that describe
each flow like the Jitter sum or the number of lost packets, etc. all of them are plotted 
to see the differences between them through the applications.
Introduction
LTE (long Term Evolution) or 4G is the fourth generation of mobile network, The 
main target of LTE network is to connect the user to the external network so that the 
user entity can send and receive to and from the external network. Simply the control 
plane is used to exchange signaling messages between the nodes, to control user 
entity data session while user plane is used to exchange user data so that the user 
entity can send and receive user data to and from the external network. LTE network 
contains the access network (E-UTRAN) and it contains the eNBs while the core 
network is called Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and it contains the MME, SGW, PGW 
and HSS that connect between the user entity and the PDN or the host.
Here the network is composed of two parts, the LTE part that contains a number of
user entities that maybe a car, laptop or even a phone, connected to one of the two 
eNBs, and the other part is the EPC part that connect the UEs to the host.
